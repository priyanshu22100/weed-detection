# Instructions to Use `Testing_Results.ipynb`

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Download the Model Paths
Before running the code, ensure you have downloaded the necessary classification and detection models. Save these model files in a directory on your system.
The model paths for classifier is named as Clf_model_pth and in the nb it is named as best_model(4).pth and the detection model yolo_v8s is named as best(3).pt.

NOTE :- Since the size of the classifier model is very large (90mB) you can download it from the following drive link :- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y74bXpF3Z0YU2afr5hT9BZHyCcHWFne2/view?usp=sharing

### 2. Using the Notebook
- Open the `final.ipynb` notebook.
- Update the paths to the classification and detection models by pasting the correct directory paths where the models are stored.
